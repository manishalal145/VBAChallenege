Stock market analyst:
This project I was suppose to be analyst examining stock data.


Step 1: 
- Created a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.
- Displayed the ticker symbol to coincide with the total volume.

Step 2:  
Looped through all the stocks to get the following info:
- Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.
- The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.
- The total Volume of the stock
- Ticker symbol
- Used conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

Step 3:
Made the appropriate adjustments to allow script to run on every worksheet just by running it once.
